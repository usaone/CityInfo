Using AutoMapper in ASP.NET Core

1. Installed NuGet package "AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection" for ASP.NET Core
2. Added line "services.AddAutoMapper(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies());" to Startup.cs
3. Created a new folder "Profiles" to hold AutoMapper profiles for classes.
4. Added a class "CityProfile" to the folder have it implement "Profile" from "Using AutoMapper"
5. Add constructor on CityProfile and add line "CreateMap<Entities.City, Models.CityWithoutPointsOfInterestDto>();"
	"CreateMap<Entities.City, Models.CityDto>();"
	Also add a class "PointOfInterestProfile" similar to above and add the following line to the constructor
	"CreateMap<Entities.PointOfInterest, Models.PointOfInterestDto>();"
	
	Note: CreateMap can be added in just one class called "MapperProfiles" implementing "Profile" from AutoMapper.

6. Open CitiesController and inject "IMapper mapper" in the constructor.
7. Then use mapper to replace all mapping code with a single line as seen across CitiesController.
8. Will continue to PointsOfInterestController next.
