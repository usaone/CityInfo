Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that lets you query and

Entity Framework Core is a lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform
version of Entity Framework.

Use annotations on entity classes to define primary and foreign keys,
required fields, etc.

DbContext represents a session with the database and can be used to query
and save instances of entities.

Migrations allow us to provide code to change the database from one 
version to another.

Use environment variables for safer storage of sensitive data.

Seeding the database is providing it with the data to start with.
